                    <p>Action research is a powerful approach to problem-solving and knowledge creation that bridges the gap between theory and practice. It is a dynamic and participatory process that empowers individuals and communities to identify, analyze, and address real-world challenges they face in their professional or personal lives. By engaging in systematic inquiry and taking action, action research enables individuals to bring about meaningful change and improve their practices.</p>
                    <p>Here at https://btec.edu.kh/, we are passionate about promoting action research as a valuable tool for learning, growth, and social transformation. Through this website, we aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of action research and its applications across various fields.</p>

                    <h3 class="pb-10">What is Action Research?</h3>
                    <p>Action research is a cyclical process that involves four main stages: planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. It encourages active collaboration between researchers and practitioners, fostering a co-learning environment. By combining research and action, this approach allows individuals to tackle complex problems through a systematic and iterative process.</p>
                    <p>Through action research, practitioners can enhance their understanding of the contextual factors influencing their work, test strategies, evaluate outcomes, and make informed decisions. This iterative process promotes continuous improvement and innovation, as it encourages adaptation and refinement based on real-time feedback.</p>
