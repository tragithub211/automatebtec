Third, there are classrooms equipped with electronic devices. In particular, there is one lab that is equipped with computers, headphones, and internet for the student teachers to facilitate learning and teaching activities. Fourth, there are study visits and English clubs for them to share their teaching and learning. Fifth, some organizations partner to help with training and run workshops for teacher educators and student teachers.</p>
