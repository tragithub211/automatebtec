                    <h3>Acting Dean's Message</h3>
                    <p>On behalf of the entire faculty of Social Science Education, I am thrilled to welcome you to our vibrant academic community. As you embark on your journey to become professional teachers, you are entering a field of immense importance and potential.</p>
                    <p>This website is intended to provide information and communication for anyone interested in our faculty, whether they are student teachers tracking a bachelor's degree (or bachelor's degree + 1) in teaching, graduates looking to further their education, or in-service teachers seeking continuous professional development (CPD) to improve teaching and researching.</p>
                    <p>Our faculty houses two distinct yet interconnected departments: Social Science and Languages. In the Social Science department, you will delve into the complexities of human behavior, societies, and cultures. In the Language department, there are Khmer language and English. You will learn to effectively teach spoken and written language skills, enabling your students to express themselves confidently and connect with others meaningfully.</p>
                    <p>The synergy between these two departments lies at the heart of our teacher education program. We believe that effective educators possess a deep understanding of both the social context and the tools of communication. They can ignite curiosity, challenge perspectives, and empower their students to become active and informed citizens.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment where you can thrive and grow. We encourage you to connect with your peers, explore your interests, and actively participate in our diverse range of extracurricular activities.</p>
