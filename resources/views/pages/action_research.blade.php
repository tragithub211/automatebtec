            <p>Action research is a cyclical process that involves four main stages: planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. It encourages active collaboration between researchers and practitioners, fostering a co-learning environment. By combining research and action, this approach allows individuals to tackle complex problems through a systematic and iterative process.</p>
            <p>Through action research, practitioners can enhance their understanding of the contextual factors influencing their work, test strategies, evaluate outcomes, and make informed decisions. This iterative process promotes continuous improvement and innovation, as it encourages adaptation and refinement based on real-time feedback.</p>
